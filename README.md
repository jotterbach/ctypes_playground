ctypes Playground
=================

This repository is intended to play with the standard Python `ctypes` library.
Its goal is to demonstrate how to wrap a simple C-array returned from a shared library
into a numpy array.

To test the code you can follow these steps:

1. clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:jotterbach/ctypes_playground.git`

2. run `make test`
